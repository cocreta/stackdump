                Stackdump is temporarily disabled while a StackExchange site is
                being imported. It will automatically become available again
                once the import process has completed. This should take no
                longer than 12 hours.

                If this message is appearing and no site is currently being
                imported, then check the Stackdump web log and ensure Stackdump
                has access to the configured database.
