The image font files for Mathjax have been removed to save space. If image fonts
are really necessary, add them back by downloading the local installation 
distribution from the Mathjax website (http://www.mathjax.org/download) and 
copying the files under fonts/HTML-CSS/TeX/png/**/* to here.

You will also need to modify 
<stackdump_home>/python/src/stackdump/templates/question.html
and remove the `imageFont:null` configuration parameter from the config section
at the top of the page.
